      FOR some inscrutable reason which she has as yet given no hint of
      revealing, Nature is wondrously wasteful in the matter of generation. She
      creates a thousand where she intends to make use of one.
    </p>
    <p>
      Imbued with the maternal instinct, the female cod casts millions of eggs
      upon the waters, expecting them to return after many days as troops of
      interesting <span class="pagenum"><a href="images/7.jpg">{7}</a></span>
      offspring. Instead, half die embryotic gadi are almost immediately
      devoured by spawn-eaters, hundreds of thousands perish in incubation,
      hundreds of thousands more succumb to the perils attending ichthyic
      infancy, leaving but a few score to attain to adult usefulness and pass an
      honored old age with the fragrance of a well-spent life in the country
      grocery.
    </p>
    <p>
      The oak showers down 10,000 acorns, each capable of producing a tree.
      Three-fourths of them are straightway diverted from their arboreal intent
      through conversion into food by the provident squirrel and improvident
      hog. Great numbers rot uselessly upon the <span class="pagenum"><a
      href="images/8.jpg">{8}</a></span> ground, and the few hundred that
      finally succeed in germinating grow up into dense thickets, where at last
      die strongest smothers out all the rest like an oaken Othello in a harem
      of quercine Desdemonas.

      THIS is the law of all life, animal as well as vegetable. From the humble
      hyssop on the wall to the towering cedar of Lebanon, from the meek and
      lowly amoeba&mdash;which has no more character or individuality than any
      other pin-point of jelly&mdash;to the lordly tyrant <span class="pagenum"><a
      href="images/9.jpg">{9}</a></span> man, the rule is inevitable and
      invariable.
    </p>
    <p>
      Life is sown broadcast only to be followed almost immediately by a
      destruction nearly as swift. Nature creates by the million apparently that
      she may destroy by the myriads. She gives life one instant only that she
      may snatch it away the next. The main difference is that the higher we
      ascend the less lavish is the creation and the less sweeping the
      destruction.
    </p>
    <p>
      Thus, while probably but one fish out of a thousand reaches maturity, of
      1,000 children born 604 attain adult age; that is, Nature flings aside 999
      out of every 1,000 fish as useless for <span class="pagenum"><a
      href="images/10.jpg">{10}</a></span> her purposes, and two out of every
      five human beings.

      MANY see in this relentless weeding out and destruction of her inferior
      products a remarkable illustration of the wisdom of Nature&rsquo;s methods. What
      would they think of a workman so bungling that two-fifths of the products
      of his handicraft were only fit for destruction?
    </p>
    <p>
      The &ldquo;struggle for existence&rdquo; is a murderous scramble to get rid of this
      vast surplusage. The &ldquo;survival of the fittest&rdquo; is the success of the
      minority in <span class="pagenum"><a href="images/11.jpg">{11}</a></span>
      demonstrating that the majority are superfluous. It is the Kilkenny-cat
      episode multiplied by infinity. It will be remembered that the whole
      trouble arose from the common belief that two cats were a surplus of one
      for the Kilkenny environment.
    </p>
    <p>
      Darwin&rsquo;s theory recognizes in this super-fecundity of nature a most potent
      adjunct for improvement He says, in fact, that the impossibility of
      providing subsistence for more than a fraction of the multitudinous
      creation causes a mortal struggle in which the weaker and inferior are
      exterminated and only the stronger and superior survive. These in turn,
      have offspring like the leaves <span class="pagenum"><a
      href="images/12.jpg">{12}</a></span> of the forest, which in like turn are
      winnowed out by alien enemies and reciprocal extermination, and thus the
      process goes on with the sanguinary regularity of the King of Dahomey&rsquo;s
      administration of the internal economy of his realm. The benignity of this
      method of arranging the order of things is not so apparent as a member of
      the Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals might desire.

    <p>
      BUT our opinion of this law is not cared for. It is academic and
      superfluous. The main importance <span class="pagenum"><a
      href="images/13.jpg">{13}</a></span> attaches to the recognition of the
      fact that it is a law.
    </p>
    <p>
      Its application to society is obvious: Since the propagation of human
      beings goes on with entire recklessness as to the quality of the product
      and the means of subsistence, some strong corrective is absolutely
      necessary to establish limits to populations and to secure the continued
      development of the race.
    </p>
    <p>
      If every begotten child lived to the average age of 40, in a very few
      years there would not be standing room on the earth for its people.
    </p>
    <p>
      Even with such limited propagators as the elephant, each female of which
      produces but six offspring in her bearing <span class="pagenum"><a
      href="images/14.jpg">{14}</a></span> period of 90 years, we are told that
      if the species had no parasitic or other enemy it would only be 740 years
      until elephants would overrun the earth.
    </p>
    <p>
      Where then should we assign limits to the productiveness of the
      750,000,000 human females on the globe, each of whom is capable of
      producing 20 children in her 30 years of bearing?
    </p>
    <p>
      If, too, every child had the same chance of life without reference to its
      mental and physical fitness to live, humanity would soon become a stagnant
      slough of vicious vitality. There are only food and room for the best, and
      as the development of the race demands <span class="pagenum"><a
      href="images/15.jpg">{15}</a></span> it, only the best survive and
      continue the work of propagation. The rest are destroyed.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /><br />
    </p>
    <hr />
    <p>
      <br /><br />
    </p>
    <p>
      BY the &ldquo;best&rdquo; is understood those having that harmony of mental and
      physical development which brings them most nearly into accord with
      Nature&rsquo;s laws.
    </p>

    <p>
      BELOW the human stratum superabundant generation is neutralized by the
      simple device of having <span class="pagenum"><a href="images/16.jpg">{16}</a></span>
      every organism prey upon some other one. In her 10 years of fruitful life
      the female cod lays 50,000,000 eggs. If nothing thwarted the amiable
      efforts of herself and offspring to multiply and replenish, they would
      shortly pack the ocean as full as a box of sardines.
    </p>
    <p>
      While, however, giving one female the desire and capacity to produce
      50,000,000 lives, nature has given other animals the desire and capacity
      to annihilate most of those 50,000,000 lives.
    </p>
    <p>
      So all through the animal kingdom it is nearly a neck-to-neck race between
      production and extermination.
    </p>
    <p>
      Life is a universal and unceasing <span class="pagenum"><a
      href="images/17.jpg">{17}</a></span> struggle, between the eaters and the
      eaten.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /><br />
    </p>
    <hr />
    <p>
      <br /><br />
    </p>
    <p>
      MAN alone is practically exempt from what is apparently an invariable
    </p>
    <p>
      condition of all other forms of animal life. While he preys upon a myriad
      of created things, there is no created thing that preys on him and assists
      in keeping his excessive produc tiveness within the limits of subsistence.
      Most significant of all, not even a parasite wages destructive warfare
      against him. That is, if we except from the classification the doctors&rsquo;
      latest explanation <span class="pagenum"><a href="images/18.jpg">{18}</a></span>
      of the cause of everything, from pneumonia to laziness&mdash;the modest
      but effective bacillus. The bacillus, however, is much more a condition
      than a parasite.
    </p>
    <p>
      This absence of destructive enemies must be compensated for in some way,
      and it is accomplished by making vicious inclinations the agents to weed
      out the redundant growths and to select for extermination those which are
      inferior, depraved, weak, and unfit for preservation or reproduction.
    </p>
    <p>
      If five human beings are procreated where there is present room and
      provision but for three, how are the surplus <span class="pagenum"><a
      href="images/19.jpg">{19}</a></span> two to be picked out and
      exterminated?
    </p>
    <p>
      Of course each one of us feels entirely competent to pick out in his own
      community the persons who could be best spared, but public opinion is at
      present hostile both to any practical plan of making the necessary
      thinning out, and also to lodging the power of selection in the hands of
      those of us best calculated for the duty.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /><br />
    </p>
    <hr />
    <p>
      <br /><br />
    </p>
    <p>
      APPARENTLY the surplus ones relieve us from embarrassment on this score by
      selecting to exterminate <span class="pagenum"><a href="images/20.jpg">{20}</a></span>
      themselves. Their methods of suicide cover a wide range of expedients but
      all are very effective.
    </p>
    <p>
      And most beneficent of any of the facts connected with this subject is
      that each of those chosen for extermination embraces his fate with
      positive eagerness, under the delusion that he is about to enhance his own
      happiness.
    </p>
    <p>
      Immoderate use of stimulants and the varied excesses and vital errors
      which are grouped under the general head of &ldquo;dissipation,&rdquo; a &ldquo;love of
      pleasure,&rdquo; or the still <span class="pagenum"><a href="images/21.jpg">{21}</a></span>
      more expressive phrase &ldquo;a short life and a merry one,&rdquo; etc., are favorite
      ways of self-annihilation and leave little to be desired in the
      completeness with which they do their work.
    </p>
    <p>
      English statisticians formerly estimated that if a man drank beer in large
      quantities it took him 21.7 years to kill himself, which period the
      whisky-drinker shortened to 16.1 years.
    </p>
    <p>
      Closer study and wider knowledge have materially changed these
      conclusions, to the great detriment of beer. For once, and upon one point,
      the physicians of the world have agreed. American, English, and German
      doctors say with one voice that the most <span class="pagenum"><a
      href="images/22.jpg">{22}</a></span> hopeless patient who comes into their
      hands is the soaked, crapulous, beer-drinker. &ldquo;Point out a gray-haired
      beer-drinker,&rdquo; they challenge, and challenge in vain. Gray-haired
      whisky-drinkers may be found, but not the others.
    </p>
    <p>
      Starch in every stage of decay, carried by the all-penetrating alcohol,
      surcharges the tissues with putrefaction, and makes the tumid veins a
      forcing-ground for bacteria. Thus the beer-drinker&rsquo;s slight cold becomes
      at once pneumonia, or inflammatory rheumatism, or Bright&rsquo;s disease, and
      his life flickers out like a candle in a gusty passage.
    </p>
    <p>
      Intemperance being among the milder vices kills slowly. Sexual sins slay
      <span class="pagenum"><a href="images/23.jpg">{23}</a></span> more
      rapidly, and the criminal grades of vice do their work with a swiftness in
      proportion to their flagrancy. The Psalmist says, &ldquo;bloody and deceitful
      men shall not live out half their days,&rdquo; but police records will show that
      David materially overrates the average. &ldquo;One quarter their days&rdquo; would
      approach much nearer exactness.

    <p>
      RETURNING to the major premise that the &ldquo;survival of the fittest&rdquo; means
      the selection and preservation of those individuals who are most nearly in
      harmony with the conditions <span class="pagenum"><a href="images/24.jpg">{24}</a></span>
      of their environment, and that the progress of the race or species
      involves the destruction of the weaker or the inferior who are not in such
      harmony, the conclusion follows that any aberration toward vice shows such
      discordance in the individual with the laws of his environment as marks
      him as inferior, weak, and obstructive of the race&rsquo;s development
    </p>
    <p>
      Vice is not so much a cause as an effect&mdash;precisely as disease is a
      symptom. Vice does not make a nature weak or defective: a weak and
      defective nature expresses its weaknesses and defects in vice, and that
      expression brings about in one way and another <span class="pagenum"><a
      href="images/25.jpg">{25}</a></span> the sovereign remedy of
      extermination.

      MUCH is said of the devastation of our fairest and brightest by the Drink
      Demon. This is mainly nonsense. It was more nearly true in former
      generations, when intemperance was an almost universal vice. As

      Hamlet says:
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     &ldquo;it is a custom

     Makes us traduced and tax&rsquo;d of other nations:
     They clepe us drunkards, and with swinish phrase
     Soil our addition.&rdquo;
 </pre>
    <p>
      <span class="pagenum"><a href="images/26.jpg">{26}</a></span> Morals has
      made wonderful progress since then, in all directions, and heavy drinking
      has been more and more restricted to those who are

    <p>
      With few exceptions every one who goes to perdition by the alcohol route
      would reach that destination by some other highway if the alcohol line
      were not running.
    </p>
    <p>
      Every man whose sloth or improvidence has brought himself and his family
      to beggary, every thieving tramp upon the highways, every rascal in the
      penitentiary, every murderer upon the gallows, hastens to plead &ldquo;whisky
      brought <span class="pagenum"><a href="images/27.jpg">{27}</a></span> me
      to this!&rdquo; because he knows that such a plea will bring him a gush of
      sloppy sympathy unobtainable by other means.
    </p>
    <p>
      Whisky makes no man lazy, shiftless, dishonest, false, cowardly or brutal.
      These must be original qualities with him. If he has them he will probably
      take to whisky&mdash;though not inevitably&mdash;which then does the
      community the splendid service of hurrying him along to destruction, and
      of abridging his infliction upon the public. <span class="pagenum"><a

    <p>
      PEOPLE who have done much in the way of reforming drunkards have been
      astonished to find how little real manhood remained after eliminating
      whisky from the equation. They had supposed the manhood to be only
      obscured, and were disheartened to find how frequently it happened to be
      demonstrated that there never was enough of it to pay for the trouble of
      &ldquo;saving the victim of intemperance.&rdquo; Like the cherubim before the throne
      of God, the Temperance orators &ldquo;con- tinually do cry,&rdquo; the burden of their
      song being that hundreds of thousands are annually slain by the monster
      Intemperance. <span class="pagenum"><a href="images/29.jpg">{29}</a></span>
      Quite singularly these figures are probably not exaggerated. Myriads of
      times kindly-hearted physicians write in the death certificate
      &ldquo;pneumonia,&rdquo; &ldquo;heart-failure,&rdquo; &ldquo;diabetes,&rdquo; etc., when truth demands &ldquo;beer&rdquo;
       or &ldquo;whisky.&rdquo;

      BUT what of this?
    </p>
    <p>
      Is it not merely Nature sweeping out her overcrowded workshop? Ridding her
      laboratory of misfits, defectives, and rejects? Into her junk pile alcohol
      whisks away daily thousands of thieves, gamblers, prostitutes, loafers,
      &ldquo;sports,&rdquo; spongers, swindlers, <span class="pagenum"><a
      href="images/30.jpg">{30}</a></span> and others of the criminal and
      quasi-criminal classes. Over their moldering clay the daisies bloom in
      sweet oblivion of

      Upon these alcoholism accommodatingly performs the office of judge and
      executioner, cutting their careers off at an average of five years, which,
      without this interposition, would possibly be extended to 20 or 30. The
      certainty and celerity with which it ferrets out and destroys these
      classes gives it strong advantages over the ordinary processes of
      destruction.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was exceedingly unfortunate for <span class="pagenum"><a
      href="images/31.jpg">{31}</a></span> the community that the leaders of the
      James and Younger gangs were temperate men. Had it not been so, their
      careers, instead of extending over 20 harassing years, would have been cut
      short inside of five. Uncontrollable predilection for whisky, and the
      society of strange women brought about the destruction of nearly all of
      the band who from time to time were slain by each other&rsquo;s hands or those
      of justice. Temperance and chastity in a rascal of any kind mean an
      immense amount of mischief to the community. Fortunately they are quite
      rare. <span class="pagenum"><a href="images/32.jpg">{32}</a></span> THE
      rapid spread of Prohibition is full of suggestion. The grain fields of
      Kansas and Texas are periodically devastated by the green bug. When the
      green bugs are at their worst a parasite appears which sweeps them off,
      and the wheat growers have a respite. Then, having destroyed their
      provender, the parasites starve, and the green bugs have a chance to grow
      again until the parasites overtake them in the hour of their triumph and

      DURING the ages of terrible oppression of the European peoples which
      culminated in the French Revolution, the main amelioration of the
      hardships endured was found in the vices of the oppressors. The sword of
      the duelist, quarreling over women, the picturesque horrors of delirium
      tremens, and the loathsome mal de Naples continually swept away hecatombs
      of tyrant lordlings and frequently obliterated whole families. In fact no
      aristocratic family ever withstood these adverse influences very long.
      Extinction came as promptly and as certainly as the curculio to the
      ripening plum. The student of French and English <span class="pagenum"><a
      href="images/34.jpg">{34}</a></span> history is continually astonished at
      the brief time in which noble names remain in view. They rise to dizzy
      eminence on one page, and on the next go down to oblivion. One rarely
      finds the name of a century or two ago mentioned in any of the European
      news of to-day. Mr. Freeman, the eminent English historian, says,
      conclusively, that in spite of the perennial vaunt of ancestors who &ldquo;came
      over with the Conqueror,&rdquo; and of Tennyson&rsquo;s musical mendacity about the
      &ldquo;daughter of an hundred Earls,&rdquo; the families who can trace back to even so
      recent a date as the reign of the Stuarts are very rare. <span
      class="pagenum"><a href="images/35.jpg">{35}</a></span> Frequently
      hundreds of years elapsed before the historic titles were &ldquo;revived&rdquo; to
      gild some parvenu. Since then these families have been kept up only by
      intermarriages with later parvenus.
    </p>
    <p>
      The royal family itself has been repeatedly on the point of extinction,
      and the continuity of the line only maintained by extraordinary efforts.

      SOCIETY has been most aptly likened to a vat of good wine, which is scum
      and froth at the top, dregs and sediment at the bottom, and good, pure,
      clear liquor in the middle. Vice does admirable work in skimming away the
      supernatant scum and in drawing off the dregs and settlings.
    </p>
    <p>
      Unceasing fermentation seems to be a condition necessary to the health of
      society. The humblest work incessantly to lift themselves into the ranks
      of <span class="pagenum"><a href="images/37.jpg">{37}</a></span> the
      middle-classes, the middle-classes strive as earnestly to make themselves
      plutocrats, aristocrats, and lordlings. This ambition for worldly
      advancement is one of society&rsquo;s most powerful adjuncts for good. When a
      man at last reaches the social summit he desists from further efforts at
      improvement. He becomes like a man who after struggling forward to reach
      the head of the procession refuses to march another step. Some vice,
      mayhap merely over-eating, is likely to remove him and secure the ground
      for another man to come to the front, who is also removed summarily when
      he becomes obstructive. If the fortune-builder is <span class="pagenum"><a
      href="images/38.jpg">{38}</a></span> not thus removed, his children are
      subject to attack.
    </p>
    <p>
      Were it not for this, the upper stratum of society would speedily become
      so crowded that ascent to it would be impossible, all healthful, ambitious
      motive be taken away from the middle and lower classes, stagnation follow,
      and society perish from congestion.

      HISTORY is full of illustrations of the benefits of vice in assisting to
      shape the destinies of Nations and peoples. Take, for example, the <span
      class="pagenum"><a href="images/39.jpg">{39}</a></span> Bourbons whose
      stupidity and tyranny have passed into a proverb. In the last century
      their worse than worthless personalities filled nearly every throne in
      southern Europe. They seemed to breed like wolves in a famine-stricken
      land, and their fangs were at every people&rsquo;s throat Fortunately they had
      vices. Wine and lechery did what human enemies could not and the pack of
      wolves rotted away like a flock of diseased sheep. The mortality was so
      regular that for a long time French kings were succeeded by their
      grand-sons and great-grandsons, their sons all burning themselves out
      before the time came for ascending the throne. <span class="pagenum"><a
      href="images/40.jpg">{40}</a></span> The unutterably vile life of Louis
      XV. was terminated by the smallpox communicated to him in the course of a
      most disgraceful amour. His grandson, who succeeded him, had no
      destructive vices, and so the people were compelled at last to resort to
      the guillotine to rid themselves of him. The vast problem for the French
      in 1790 would have been greatly simplified if Louis XVI. had been a
      shortlived debauchee like his father and two brothers. The healthy German
      blood of his Saxon mother corrected some-what the virus in the Bourbon
      veins, and he lived to become an intolerable cumberer and obstructive.

      <span class="pagenum"><a href="images/41.jpg">{41}</a></span> The only
      Bourbon still remaining on a throne is the King of Spain, and his teeth
      are on edge from the sour grapes of unchastity which his fathers and
      mothers ate.
    </p>
    <p>
      Like his grandmother, the notorious Isabella II, his father, aunts, and
      cousins, and indeed every one of the Bourbons, he is a sad physical
      weakling.
    </p>
    <p>
      The physicians politely term &ldquo;scrofulous diathesis&rdquo; the syphilitic taint
      of the Bourbon blood. In his grandmother it showed itself in a repulsive
      cutaneous disease which she tried to ameliorate or cure in a truly
      Bourbon-ish way, by having her underclothing <span class="pagenum"><a
      href="images/42.jpg">{42}</a></span> previously worn by a nun of high
      repute for piety.
    </p>
    <p>
      Alfonso&rsquo;s XIII.&lsquo;s father burned himself out at the age of 28. His aunts
      and kinsmen all had some one or more of scrofula&rsquo;s varied physical
      degradations and deformities, and went out from time to time like ill-made
      candles.
    </p>
    <p>
      Though the hopes of his race and the peace of his country depend upon
      Alfonso&rsquo;s life, all the care given him in his boyhood could do no more
      than slightly mitigate the ancestral blight.

      <span class="pagenum"><a href="images/43.jpg">{43}</a></span> A FEW years
      ago the people of Holland were threatened with a most serious calamity.
      Depraved heredity, unwise sexual selection, or some other primal cause had
      resulted in the production, as the Prince of Orange&mdash;the Crown Prince&mdash;of
      an individual of a weak, inferior, and depraved nature. His was such a
      nature as on a throne becomes a fountain of numberless oppressions and
      evils, and rarely fails to goad the unhappy subjects into rebellion,
      attended with the usual frightful loss of life and property and vast
      sorrows. Fortunately he had destructive vices. The appetite for these led
      him to Paris. A few years of riot and <span class="pagenum"><a
      href="images/44.jpg">{44}</a></span> debauchery sapped away the dangerous
      life of &ldquo;Lemons,&rdquo; as his worthless boon-companions named him, and he died
      as the fool dieth. The only harm he was able to do was the indirect damage
      of a bad example, and the good people of the Netherlands were rid of a
      possible Louis XV. at no greater cost than that of some years of
      extravagant life in the French capital. His father&rsquo;s evil excesses and
      penchant for pretty ballet-girls left as his only successor a young not
      over-strong girl, who thus far has failed to produce an heir to the
      throne, to the deep disappointment of such of her people as love royalty.
      Holland will, therefore, <span class="pagenum"><a href="images/45.jpg">{45}</a></span>
      in all probability, glide into a republic without the usual sanguinary
      convulsions attending such transitions.

      conspicuous contrast to the royal and aristocratic families just alluded
      to are the houses of Hohenzollern and Savoy.
    </p>
    <p>
      A thrifty burgher of Nuremberg, eager to get into the landed aristocracy
      on any terms, foreclosed a mortgage on a stretch of most unpromising sand
      and swamp around Brandenberg. It was of so little worth as to be
      frequently spoken of as &ldquo;the sandbox of the Holy Roman Empire,&rdquo; The
      Hohenzollerns
    </p>
    <p>
      attacked this uninviting problem with real German thrift and tenacity.
      They resolved to make their swamps and sand barrens productive like the
      rich lands of their neighbors. <span class="pagenum"><a
      href="images/47.jpg">{47}</a></span> Flinching from no drudgery
      themselves, they would allow none of their people to do so. Every
      Hohenzollern son and daughter was brought up to unsparing hard work,
      severe economy, plain food and coarse clothing, with a rigid code of
      morals.
    </p>
    <p>
      At the time when the example of Louis XIV. was debauching every German
      princeling into having a showy court with a pretentious palace and a
      tinseled retinue, all wrung from the poor peasantry, the King of Prussia
      was running his court after the manner of a close-fisted, land-gaining
      German farmer.
    </p>
    <p>
      Cabbages that could not be sold <span class="pagenum"><a
      href="images/48.jpg">{48}</a></span> were served on the royal tables in
      order to save a few thalers for the support of the army, and add to the
      war chest.
    </p>
    <p>
      The shabby appointments of the palace were the derision of Europe. The
      common people of Prussia had, however, a much larger share of what their
      labor produced than those of any other part of Europe. The King not only
      set a good example in making the most out of everything, but he personally
      caned lessons of industry and frugality into his people, high and low.
    </p>
    <p>
      There were occasionally black sheep in even such a sternly regulated
      family, but as a general rule the sons and daughters married strong, clean
      mates, <span class="pagenum"><a href="images/49.jpg">{49}</a></span> and
      strictly maintained the family traditions. A provision against the way
      ward princelings was made by which their possessions passed into the main
      house if they fell below the standard. So the Hohenzollerns grew, and
      Prussia grew from a despised sandbarren to be one of the Six Great Powers
      of Europe, and is now the head of the mighty German Empire. We do not have
      as full history of the House of Savoy, but we have enough to know that in
      much the same way, at the same time, and by much the same moral
      discipline, it arose from the lordship of a little stretch of mountain
      <span class="pagenum"><a href="images/50.jpg">{50}</a></span> land in the
      Alps to rule over United Italy.

      THE most attractive feature of this self-pruning of the objectionable
      growths in society, as said before, is that the victims destroy themselves
      under the hallucination that they are drinking the richest wine of earthly
      pleasure. When execution can be made a matter of keen relish to the
      condemned, certainly nothing is wanting on the score of humanity.

    <p>
      <span class="pagenum"><a href="images/51.jpg">{51}</a></span> I ANTICIPATE
      the objection that slaying bad men by means of their own vicious
      propensities brings much misery to those connected with them.
    </p>
    <p>
      But then all innocent persons connected with bad men are fated to suffer
      in exact proportion to the closeness of the connection, whether the bad
      men are destroyed or not. Weak, selfish, perverted, and criminal men
      always inflict misery upon their relatives and associates. This is not
      usually intensified by their being drunkards or debauchees.
    </p>
    <p>
      It is also true that no one of Nature&rsquo;s methods of extinction is pleasant
      <span class="pagenum"><a href="images/52.jpg">{52}</a></span> to those
      connected with the victim. The thief or thug, prematurely dying with
      delirium tremens, is certainly quite as bearable a sight to those before
      whose eyes it may come as the spectacle of a virtuous man, the sole
      support of his family, slowly wasting away with consumption in spite of
      all that loving service and agonizing sympathy can do to retain for him a
      life that is of so much value.

      TO the next objection that the practice of vice is not invariably
      suicidal, since many rascals live to attain as <span class="pagenum"><a
      href="images/53.jpg">{53}</a></span> green an old age as the most
      righteous, it is sufficient to say that plentiful as these exceptions may
      occasionally seem, their proportion to the whole number is at least as
      small as that of the exceptions to any other general law of biology.
    </p>
    <p>
      The policeman on the next corner will bear decided testimony that the
      number of scoundrels who survive their 30th year is astonishingly small,
      and he can point out any number of erstwhile troublesome members of the
      community who are ending their lives in penitentiary, poorhouse, or
      hospital at an age when well-behaved men are <span class="pagenum"><a
      href="images/54.jpg">{54}</a></span> just entering upon the serious
      business of life.
    </p>
    <p>
      It is also demonstrable that the proportion of vicious men to the whole
      population is much less to-day than at any previous period in the history
      of the race. This shows conclusively the improvement of society by the
      self-destructiveness of vice. The proportion of bad men is rapidly
      diminishing, because bad men die sooner and propagate fewer than good
      ones. <span class="pagenum"><a href="images/55.jpg">{55}</a></span> <br /><br />
